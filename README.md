# Yearn Strategy MIR UST UNI LP

This strategy is built on top of the Mushroom MIR UST strategy it uses the MM token to increase the yield.

## Installation and Setup

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) & [Ganache-CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli), if you haven't already.

2. Sign up for [Infura](https://infura.io/) and generate an API key. Store it in the `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

```bash
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=YourProjectID
```

3. Sign up for [Etherscan](www.etherscan.io) and generate an API key. This is required for fetching source codes of the mainnet contracts we will be interacting with. Store the API key in the `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN` environment variable.

```bash
export ETHERSCAN_TOKEN=YourApiToken
```

4. Download the mix.

```bash
brownie bake yearn-strategy
```


## Testing

To run the tests:

```
brownie test
```

The example tests provided in this mix start by deploying and approving your [`Strategy.sol`](contracts/Strategy.sol) contract. This ensures that the loan executes succesfully without any custom logic. Once you have built your own logic, you should edit [`tests/test_flashloan.py`](tests/test_flashloan.py) and remove this initial funding logic.

See the [Brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests-pytest-intro.html) for more detailed information on testing your project.

## Debugging Failed Transactions

Use the `--interactive` flag to open a console immediatly after each failing test:

```
brownie test --interactive
```

Within the console, transaction data is available in the [`history`](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api-network.html#txhistory) container:

```python
>>> history
[<Transaction '0x50f41e2a3c3f44e5d57ae294a8f872f7b97de0cb79b2a4f43cf9f2b6bac61fb4'>,
 <Transaction '0xb05a87885790b579982983e7079d811c1e269b2c678d99ecb0a3a5104a666138'>]
```

Examine the [`TransactionReceipt`](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api-network.html#transactionreceipt) for the failed test to determine what went wrong. For example, to view a traceback:

```python
>>> tx = history[-1]
>>> tx.traceback()
```

To view a tree map of how the transaction executed:

```python
>>> tx.call_trace()
```

See the [Brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core-transactions.html) for more detailed information on debugging failed transactions.

<!--
## Deployment

When you are finished testing and ready to deploy to the mainnet:

1. [Import a keystore](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/account-management.html#importing-from-a-private-key) into Brownie for the account you wish to deploy from.
2. Edit [`scripts/deployment.py`](scripts/deployment.py) and add your keystore ID according to the comments.
3. Run the deployment script on the mainnet using the following command:

```bash
$ brownie run deployment --network mainnet
```

You will be prompted to enter your keystore password, and then the contract will be deployed.
-->

## Known issues

### No access to archive state errors

If you are using Ganache to fork a network, then you may have issues with the blockchain archive state every 30 minutes. This is due to your node provider (i.e. Infura) only allowing free users access to 30 minutes of archive state. To solve this, upgrade to a paid plan, or simply restart your ganache instance and redploy your contracts.
